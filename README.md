# Cart by Sallam 🛍️

**Demo Shopping Cart Website** built for fun and learning.  

> Just a small project while experimenting with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
> Totally beginner-friendly and not a professional product 😄

## What it does

- Shows 20+ products (phones, laptops, watches, gaming, audio, cameras…) with images, names, and prices.
- Add products to a cart, view the cart, change quantity, or remove items.
- Dynamically updates total price in PKR.
- Search products and filter by category.
- Light cream → soft blue aesthetic theme.

## Live Demo

Check it out here: [https://cartbysalamdemo.netlify.app](https://cartbysalamdemo.netlify.app)

## How to run locally

1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP.
2. Open `index.htm` in a browser (Chrome recommended).
3. All pages are static, no server or backend needed.
4. Start adding products to the cart and have fun! 🎉

## Tech Used

- HTML & CSS (with Bootstrap for basic styling)
- JavaScript for cart functionality
- LocalStorage to save your cart across pages

## Notes

- This is just a **learning/demo project**, so nothing is real (payments, checkout, etc.).
- Feel free to fork or modify it if you want to experiment yourself!
