# -Cart-by-Sallam-Demo-Shopping-Cart-Website-
Hey there! 👋

This is a fun little demo project I built while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nothing fancy or production-ready — just me experimenting and practicing web development!

What it does

Displays 20+ products (phones, laptops, watches, gaming stuff…) with images, names, and prices.

Lets you add products to a cart.

Lets you view your cart, change quantities, remove items, and see the total price.

Uses localStorage so your cart stays even if you refresh the page.

Includes a search bar, categories, and a simple checkout flow (all demo, no real payments).

Beginner-friendly UI with a light cream → soft blue gradient theme.

Demo

How to run it locally

Download or clone this repo.

Open index.htm in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge…).

Explore, add items to your cart, and have fun!

Tech & Tools

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Bootstrap 5 CDN for styling

localStorage to save your cart

Notes

This is purely a learning/demo project — no backend, no real payments.

Perfect for beginners who want to practice JS, DOM manipulation, and basic web layouts.

Contributions aren’t needed — but you can fork and experiment if you like 😄
